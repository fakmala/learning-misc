#### tasks
### Part 1
## - Use a command to print out the entire contents of the `poem.txt` file. Use an option so that the output also includes line numbers.
cat -n poem.txt
## - That is a headache to read all at once! Read poem.txt using `less` instead.
less poem.txt
#    - Scroll down one line at a time
#    - Scroll up one line at a time
#    - Scroll down one "page" at a time
#    - Scroll up one "page" at a time
## - Search within less for the term "Dog".  Can you find the line that contains it?
/Dog
## - **BONUS:** can you run a case-insesitive search?  The poem contains both "dog" and "Dog" on separate lines.
less -i poem.txt
/dog
## - Now it's time to do some research! Find the option to tell less to open with lines numbers displayed. Open `poem.txt` this way
less -N poem.txt
##- Then find the "command" you can type into less to go to exactly 50% of the way through the file.
less poem.txt
50%
## - Use a command to find the number of **words** in `poem.txt`
wc -w poem.txt
## - Run a command to print out the first 4 lines of `poem.txt`
head -4 poem.txt
- Run a command to print out the last 8 lines of `poem.txt`
tail -8 poem.txt

### Part 2
## - Run a command to print out the lines in `purchases.txt` in reverse order (last line printed first)
tac purchases.txt
## - Run a command to print out the lines in `purchases.txt`, sorted alphabetically.
sort purchases.txt
## - Run a command to count the number of **lines** in `purchases.txt`
wc -l purchases.txt
## - Run a command to print out the lines in `purchases.txt`, sorted by the price (the final column) in the dataset in REVERSE order (highest price to lowest price)
