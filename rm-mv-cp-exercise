#### Deleting, Moving & Copying Exercise

### Part 1: Creating The Folders & Files
## Before we can delete, move, or copy things...we need things! It's time to get some more practice using `touch` and `mkdir`
## Please create a new directory somewhere on your machine called `Bootcamp`.  Inside of it, create the the folders and files indicated below:

```bash
**Bootcamp/**
	**FallCohort/**
		Italo.txt
		Edgar.txt
		Linus.txt
		Sara.txt 
		Silvio.txt
		**Waitlist/**
			Hanna.txt
			Haris.txt
			Netta.txt
	**WinterCohort/**
		Santiago.txt
		Iris.txt
		Naomi.txt
```
# create the directories & the files
mkdir Bootcamp
cd Bootcamp
mkdir FallCohort WinterCohort
cd FallCohort
touch Italo.txt Edgar.txt Linus.txt Sara.txt Silvio.txt
mkdir Waitlist
cd Waitlist
touch Hanna.txt Haris.txt Netta.txt
cd ~/exercises/rm-mv-cp-exercise/Bootcamp/WinterCohort
touch Santiago.txt Iris.txt Naomi.txt
# check if theres any mistake
ls -R ~/exercises/rm-mv-cp-exercise

### Part 2:
## 1. Sadly `Edgar` had to drop out of the course.  Delete the `Edgar.txt` file in `FallCohort`
cd ~/exercises/rm-mv-cp-exercise/Bootcamp/
rm FallCohort/Edgar.txt
## 2. This means we now have space in our Fall Cohort to move someone off of the waitlist.  Please move `Netta.txt` from the `Waitlist` folder into the `FallCohort` folder.
mv FallCohort/Waitlist/Netta.txt FallCohort
## 3. Please delete the `Waitlist` folder and its contents
rm -r FallCohort/Waitlist
## 4. It turns out that I misspelled Sara.  She spells her name "Sarah" with an "h" at the end.  Please rename the `Sara.txt` file to `Sarah.txt`
mv FallCohort/Sara.txt FallCohort/Sarah.txt
## 5. Unfortunately Italo is having a bit of a personal emergency, and he would like to move to our WinterCohort.  Please move the `Italo.txt` file from `FallCohort` to the `WinterCohort` folder
mv FallCohort/Italo.txt WinterCohort
## 6. Oh no, our entire Winter Cohort had to be cancelled because of a worldwide pandemic :(   We decided to bump all of the scheduled winter students to spring. In the `Bootcamp` directory create a copy of the `WinterCohort` folder called `SpringCohort`
cp -R WinterCohort SpringCohort
## 7. Please rename the WinterCohort folder to `WinterCohortCANCELLED`
mv -d WinterCohort WinterCohortCANCELLED
## 8. Oh no! We're going out of business. Please delete the entire `Bootcamp` directory ðŸ˜¢
cd ~/exercises/rm-mv-cp-exercise
rm -r Bootcamp
