#### Expansion Exercise
### Part 1 - Making Some Files
## Create the following 60 files using a single command with the powers of expansion!

'''morning-day-1
morning-day-2
...
morning-day-30


afternoon-day-1
afternoon-day-2
... 
afternoon-day-30'''
touch {morning,afternoon​}-day-{1..30}
## For this next bit, you'll need to use the following command: date +"%m-%d-%y" This command will print out the current date using the format month-day-year, like 09-19-21. Use this command to create a new file with the name todos-DATE.txt, where DATE is the output of the above date command.  For example, if we ran the command on September 19th 2021, the resulting file would be named todos-09-19-21.txt.  
touch "todos-$(date +"%m-%d-%y").txt"

### Part 2 
## Using the files that we created in the previous section...
## List out all the files that end with the number 9 
ls *9
## List out all the filenames where the second to last character is 1
ls *1?
## List out all the files that start with afternoon and then end with the number 7
ls afternoon*7
## Make a new folder called Mornings, and move all the files that start with morning inside of it.
mkdir Mornings
mv morning* Mornings

### Part 3
## Using a SINGLE command (with expansion), create the following folder structure.  You will need to use the -p option with mkdir!
Year/
	Winter/
		Yard/
		House/
	Spring/
		Yard/
		House/
	Summer/
		Yard/
		House/
	Fall/
		Yard/
		House/
​mkdir -p 2024/{Winter,Spring,Summer,Fall}/{Yard,House}/
## Finally, in each of the Yard/ and House/ Directories create a todos.txt file and a done.txt file.  Do this with a single line, without changing directories!  Use expansion! The resulting folder/file structure should look like this:
Year/
	Winter/
		Yard/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
		House/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
	Spring/
		Yard/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
		House/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
	Summer/
		Yard/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
		House/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
	Fall/
		Yard/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
		House/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
touch 2024/{Winter,Spring,Summer,Fall}/{Yard,House}/{done,todos}.txt
