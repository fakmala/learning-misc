## in a **single** command, move from the `Chickens` directory to the `Geese` directory.  Consult the folder structure written out above if needed.
cd ~/Farm/Coop/Geese
## how many geese (files) are in the `Geese` directory?
ls
# there are four geese: Amelia  Boris  Lucy  Muffin
## one of the geese is sitting on a golden egg!  it's larger than the other geese. which one is it?  (which file in the `Geese` folder is the largest?).  use a command to figure it out!
ls -lsh

## navigate to the `Horses` directory.  consult the folder structure written out above, if needed.
cd ~/Farm/Stable/Horses
## how many horses are in the `Horses` directory?
ls
# there are 4 horses: Archer  Buttons  Cookie  Jett
## wait! there is a hidden horse in the `Horses` directory! what is it's name??
ls -a
# output: .  ..  Archer  Buttons  Cookie  Jett  .Troy
# conclusion: the hidden horse's name is `.Troy`
## Bonus: List out the contents of the Horses directory as a comma separated list.  You'll need to dig into the man pages to find the correct option.  Perhaps search the ls man page for "comma"?
# look up the option on manual
man ls
/comma
q
# found it; --format=commas or -m
ls -m
# output: Archer, Buttons, Cookie, Jett
